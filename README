This repository contains the scripts used to configure and run various workloads for workload characterization.

Characterization is done using Intel Cache Allocation Technology (CAT), due to the performance guarantees CAT provides when workloads are co-located. Once the workload performance is correlated to the LLC size, it's working set size has been determined, a profile is created which can be used for co-location.

The submodules in this repository are the workloads which have been profiled.
